Big O Notation

The efficiency of algorithms.

Objectives:
  1) Explain how Big O notation is used to describe algorithms.
  2) Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
  3) Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.

The Worst Case Scenario: The way we compare algorithms
  - The worst way the code could perform, take the longest, use the most memory

Big O Notation- The relationship between functions based on their growth rates
  Time complexity - slightly more complicated than space complexity
    - Not actually measuring the amount of time in ms or sec.  Instead, considering
      the number of basic steps the algorithm needs to execute, relative to the
      size of the data set.

  Space complexity

                            Classes of Complexity:

-Highly Efficient-                -Pretty Good-                    -Inefficient-
Constant complexity	            Linear complexity	          Quadratic complexity
Logarithmic complexity		      Factorial complexity
