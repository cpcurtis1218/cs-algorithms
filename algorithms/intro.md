Objectives:

  1) Understand the role of algorithms
  2) Define the two classifications of algorithms, and how they are used.

What is an algorithm?
  Simply put, an algorithm is a process - a set of steps to reach a goal.

The big one: Google Search Algorithm - EMDs - exact match domains
  Not as common now, since most brands will use their brand name as their domain
  Searching "watch movies online free" will now show netflix/hulu etc.

2 major types of algorithms:
  Sorting - puts items in order
    -Anything that is put in order uses some type of sorting algorithm
  Searching - retrieves information stored in a data structure
    -Spell Check, Sign In, Google Search, etc.

Algorithms are evaluated based on computational complexity - How long does it take,
  or how much resources (computational power, RAM, etc.) does the search require?

  2 Main Resources:
    Time: How long does it take?
    Space: The amount of computer memory the algorithm needs

  The data set is also an important factor:
    Is it really big or really small?
    Very structured or unstructured?
    What types of data does it contain?

Specific Types of Algorithms:
  Sorting:
    Bubble sort
    Insertion sort
    Merge sort
    Quick sort
    Bucket sort
    Radix sort
  Searching:
    Binary search
    Brute force search
