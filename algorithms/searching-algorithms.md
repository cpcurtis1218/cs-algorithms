Searching Algorithms

-Objectives-

  1) Understand Big O complexity of brute force and binary search approaches.
  2) Describe how Binary Search works.
  3) Write a binary search algorithm to find a value in an array.

-Brute Force-

  The idea that an algorithm will try check every possibility or element.

-Binary Search-
